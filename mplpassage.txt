•	The "Component Feedback" feature in CM2P plays a crucial role in the risk assessment process during the transition of a design to the Ready For Layout (RFL) stage. When an Application Engineer sets a CM2P to RFL, the system automatically evaluates the components used within the design. If any components have a Preferred Level marked as "NO" or possess a Material Status of 82 or higher, or if the Material Status is greater than 0 but less than 80, the system triggers a risk assessment email. This email alerts the Component Engineering team to potential issues with the components selected. The Component team then downloads the risk assessment data, reviews the flagged components, and provides feedback on their suitability or suggests alternatives. This process ensures that only approved and reliable components are utilized in the design, thereby maintaining quality standards and mitigating potential risks in the product development lifecycle.
•	Risk assessment email will be generated if CM2P contains components with Preferred Level = NO or with Material Status >= 82 or (Material Status > 0 and Material Status 80)
•	Layout Schematic” menu button will be visible to the user who has “Schematic Creator” or “Series Developer” role.

•	The "Lock CM2P/Prepare Generation Data" button in the CM2P interface may be disabled due to two primary reasons: firstly, if the user has not generated the delta for a new layout schematic in the "Basic Schematic" tab, which is essential for capturing changes between schematic versions; and secondly, if there are unresolved package mismatches identified in the "Mismatches" tab, indicating inconsistencies in component or package data that need to be addressed before proceeding. Ensuring that the delta is generated, and all mismatches are resolved will enable the button, allowing the user to lock the CM2P and prepare the generation data.
•	If an exported layout schematic is not appearing in the grid within the CM2P interface, it is likely because the user has not clicked the "Refresh Table" button. This action is necessary to update the grid and display the most recent exported layout schematics. Without refreshing, newly exported schematics may not be visible in the grid.
•	The "Check Release Status" button in the layout schematic section becomes enabled when two conditions are met: the user must select a row in the exported layout schematics grid, and the selected row must not contain any errors. This ensures that only valid and error-free schematics are considered for release status checks.

•	CM2P Release Process includes as follows:1. Each Circuit Management Team member assures that the design is completed. 2. It checks the CM2P and gives a release recommendation.3. If all Circuit Management Team members have approved the CM2P it can be set to RFL by the Application Engineer.
•	The LDC Kickoff Meeting involves discussions on project requirements, including documentation such as new project requirements, system architecture, function variants, timing, and risks. Participants typically include the Circuit Management Team—comprising the Application/Base Project Lead, Schematic Creator, Boehmer, Marcks—and the Function Developers. Following this, the Development Kickoff Meeting is held, where the function, architecture, and requirements are officially handed over to the module development team, marking the start of electronic design activities along with a presentation of the project timeline.
•	The Module Development phase focuses on developing electronic circuits based on the defined architecture, function variants, and requirements. As part of this process, circuit modules are created and provided within the Master Part List (MPL) system.
•	The LDC Closure process begins with each Circuit Manager formally verifying that all activities within their area of responsibility are fully completed. A formal meeting is then conducted to approve the official closure of the project. This is followed by a retrospective to evaluate the overall LDC workflow and the documentation of any identified workflow improvements for future reference.
•	The Functional Module Concept is based on the principle that circuit modules are often combined with other modules to realize a complete function—for example, combining CAN_INTERFACE_AA_01_REV15.001 with CAN_TRANSCEIVER_01.001. A function variant will only fulfill its requirements if a valid and verified combination of modules is selected. This concept enables the documentation of such validated circuit module combinations in the MPL database to define complete function variants. For projects requiring ASPICE certification, adherence to the Functional Module Concept is mandatory, along with comprehensive requirements documentation in DOORS NG. Within the MPL system, users can select between Modular Projects, which use only circuit modules as in CM2P/LM2P, and Functional Projects, which apply the Functional Module Concept, where FCM2P/FLM2P includes both the function variant and the associated module selection.

•	In the Functional Module Concept, when a new function or module group is created in MPL, it is automatically synchronized to DOORS NG through a one-way synchronization process—from MPL to DOORS NG. While the module group itself is transferred, the individual modules attached to the group are not copied to DOORS NG. Any renaming performed in MPL is reflected in DOORS NG as well. MPL continuously compares its data structure with that in DOORS NG, and if any inconsistency is detected, an automated email notification is sent to the user. Additionally, specific prefixes such as FUNC_, VAR_, and CMG_ are added only within DOORS NG to distinguish different elements.

•	To achieve ASPICE certification, project development must be based on robust requirements management in DOORS NG. Requirements must be assigned specifically to Function Variants and Module Groups through traceability links (traces) within DOORS NG. Requirements are not to be assigned to Function Groups, Functions, or individual Circuit Modules. All requirements are documented exclusively in DOORS NG, not in MPL. During the Development Kickoff Meeting, these requirements are formally handed over to the module development team. The official commissioning (Beauftragung) of module development is based on the requirements that are assigned to the corresponding Function Variants.

•	A Module Group in the Functional Module Concept defines the specific combination of circuit modules required to realize a particular Function Variant. For a single Function Variant, multiple Module Groups can exist, each representing different design requirements or alternative design realizations. The selected Module Group determines the population of modules in both the FCM2P and FLM2P representations within the MPL system.
•	In the Functional Module Concept, a Module Group can exist in several lifecycle states that govern its usage and visibility within the MPL system. When marked as Visible, the Module Group is displayed on the FCM2P page of MPL and can be selected by the Application Engineer. Visibility is set by the Function Developer and also depends on the visibility of the individual circuit modules within the group. Even if a Module Group is Invisible, it may still be used in a project, provided that the contained modules are visible or an approved request for using invisible modules exists. By default, Module Groups are set to Visible. A Module Group is considered Approved once it has been reviewed by the Function Developer and is confirmed to fulfill the requirements defined in DOORS NG for the associated Function Variant and Module Group; the default state is Unapproved. Additionally, a Module Group can be Deactivated to prevent further use, in which case it can no longer be used in FCM2P/FLM2P, and the RFL (Request for Layout) is blocked. When a Module Group is deactivated, an email notification is sent to the FCM2P owner. The default state for usage is Activated.
•	When implementing the Functional Module Concept, specific technical rules must be followed to ensure correct and consistent naming of Function Groups, Functions, and Function Variants. First, all names must be unique—a name assigned to a Function Group, Function, or Function Variant must not be reused in any other context. Additionally, names must be distinct from Circuit Module names to avoid conflicts. Only alphanumeric characters and underscores (A–Z, a–z, 0–9, _) are allowed; special characters such as spaces, hyphens (-), and dots (.) are not permitted. Furthermore, each name must begin with a letter, which supports easier search and replace operations across documentation platforms like Office, DOORS NG, and Feature Models.

•	If you are unable to export data to Excel from MPL, a common fix involves repairing the Microsoft Office installation. Start by typing “Control Panel” in the Windows search bar and opening the Control Panel. Set the view to “Category”, then click “Uninstall a program” under Programs. Locate and select “Microsoft Office 365…” in the program list, then double-click “Change”. When prompted by Windows asking for permission to allow changes, click “Yes”. In the repair options, select the “Quick Repair” radio button and click “Repair”. A confirmation popup will appear saying, “Ready to start a Quick Repair?” — click “Repair” again to start the process. Once the repair is in progress, wait until it completes and a message pops up stating “Done repairing!”. Click “Close” to finish. After completing these steps, you can restart the export feature in the MPL application, which should now work correctl

•	ECDM – Electronic component Data Management. In this database order code, supplier details, ECDM nomenclature, plant details are kept. Designer searches component in ECDM and get the A2Cxxxxx number and also he can find Zuken part number.
•	Checks performed in Plugin -
1.	While we are trying to export schematic into MPL, few checking is performed such as whether path (which is visible at the top left corner of the DG) defined in the DG or not.
2.	Also it checks whether Schematic is closed or not. That means an open schematic can’t be exported. It will be shown as a locked. Why it is checked because user may change the schematic but has not saved it and he tries to export it. So to export modified record, schematic is kept in locked if it is still open and if user try to close it, a pop will ask to save it and then it will be saved. 
3.	Another check is credential of the user verification.



•	Open All available description button– It gives all description of all circuit modules and will be picked up from database. All description means Circuit module master description, variant decryption, version description.
•	Open All Modules button – only for Michael Braumann and super user. It gives all modules. Why is that require? Because we need to protect our data. If it is available for all, any user can download it and take it into a memory stick and can transfer to other company. To protect that it is restricted. That is the reason, some buttons are only available for trusted user.
•	Open family button – It opens all modules which are under the selected module in the application. That means if user select ‘ANALOG_SENSOR_INPUT_01’, then it will show all modules variant and version which are under this module ‘ANALOG_SENSOR_INPUT_01’. All visible, invisible modules will be shown.
•	All master modules have been shown in application as 0 variant and 0 version. But originally in DG, it is mentioned MAST ER that means ‘MAST’ means variant and ‘ER’ means version. In Mentographics it was full word MASTER.
•	MASTER declares which component belongs to which family. At the end, reference designator is relevant to MPL DB. Module master is the reference for all variant master. You can create new variant deleting component from the master or changing the value of the component. Master Module is logic of all variant that means Master module is the 
•	If we create variant we have to check whether theoretically Net list are equal or not with the Master.
•	Module Matrix Button – This is a view for Module designer, which gives BOM compare. In the left first row is the reference designator of the selected module of the application which is compared with all other variant of that circuit module.
•	Open variant button – means all versions for that variant will be opened.
•	Open Version button – Selected version under selected variant will be opened. This button location must be under the Type field. Because it also reflects the CM or EM type of the module.
•	Update Variant and Update Family button -Designer works Project per Project. And in the Project generally same module few variants are used. So if they want to update at a time below values as shown in the image they can do it selecting the check boxes and pressing update button. It will update whole variant or whole family. Sometimes follow up module is created from existing module and all old module family must be disabled. With this button it can be easily disabled setting visible No.
•	Show Project Button – will display all projects where the selected Circuit Module is used.
•	Show Component Button – will display all components(Bill of materials) which are in the selected Circuit Module.
•	Show Proposed Replacement Button – It Shows the update defined in the preferred part list.
Preferred Part list is centralized document valid for all circuit modules. It defines which component will be used for VED Product. Frankfurt, Ingolstadt, Sibiu has team who worked together for the Preferred Part List. Some components are phased out by supplier or some component has production issues or some new components with better features are available or some has soldering problems or some could not complete life time then Preferred part list table is modified with setting part number to NO that blocks use that component in new design.
•	When a product is released then it transferred from development team to Quality team. If there is a issue quality team will check whether it is a  issue  for  single unit or an issue for multiple unit with different type. Then they inform development team and then development team phased out all the component setting it to NO. Message number 5 is generated showing components which are NO.
•	If any one component of a Circuit Module has NO component we can’t use that Circuit Module.
•	Material status is set to 80 when it is brought out. But if the component is phased out we set the material status to 90.  And then Ingolstadt team set the component to NO in the excel sheet for that component and upload it in the MPL.	
•	If any component for a circuit module  is missing in the Preferred Part List table, message number 4 is generated and send to the component team


•	Topology defines the connections between components within a Circuit Module (CM) as well as the connections to other CMs. Each component consists of multiple pins, with each pin having a specific designation on the component—for example, component R4711 has pins 1 and 2. The topology includes all node information for the module, detailing how these pins and components are interconnected.
•	A Circuit Module (CM) represents a defined portion of a schematic, following the approach of splitting the overall schematic into smaller, manageable pieces. In the DG schematic system, all schematics within a master design (such as ER03 exclusive or CAirS) maintain a unique and consistent numbering for component positions—meaning a specific component always has the same reference designator if it occupies the same position across schematics. Each Circuit Module fully defines a segment of the schematic, including its topology (connections) and Bill of Materials (BOM). Key elements within a CM include the Reference Designator, which identifies the component’s position in the design, and the Part Name, which serves as a unique key linked to the Zuken Library. This linkage provides all technical parameters and logistics information for the component, including the Package Name that defines its footprint and the CSE PDM Part Number, which connects to the logistic ID in the SAP system. The part number also represents the contractual relationship between Conti purchasing and the supplier.
•	The Module Schematics Workflow begins with the creation or update of the master schematic, followed by its release in MPL. Next, a variant is created or updated and then released in MPL to the ML1 stage. The module developer performs a correctness check before the schematic is further released in MPL to the ML3 or MP4 stage. Afterward, module compatibility information is added, along with the module description. Finally, when the module is phased out, its visibility is changed to invisible.
•	In MPL, the module schematics undergo several important checks to ensure consistency and correctness. Each component within the module schematic must align with the ZCOMPDB database. Reference designators follow a specific format: they begin with a capital Latin letter Y as a prefix, followed by either a 4-digit unsigned integer between 0000 and 9999, or a single digit z between 1 and 9 (without zero). All components are assigned a preferred level of High, Medium, or Low, with none causing errors. Material status for components must be less than or equal to 80, as defined in the X-Plant Material Status documentation. There must be no duplicate IDs in the Property Viewer. Each network connection (NetCon) has both an ON and OFF definition in the Accept Net, a feature implemented post-migration. The MPL_CM_MASTER must be listed in the masters such as ER03 or CAirS, and the MPL_CM_SCHEMATIC type is defined as MODULE. Comments for the module include tags such as MPL_CM_VARIANT, MPL_CM_VERSION, MPL_CM_TYPE, and MPL_CM_NAME, while the MPL_CM_REF_PRIORITY is color-coded as RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, BLUE, or GREEN to indicate priority levels.

•	The master schematic must include all reference designators defined across all variants, versions, and types within its family, excluding those components listed in the Exception Table. The MPL_CM_VARIANT is set to MAST, the MPL_CM_VERSION is identified as ER, and the MPL_CM_TYPE is specified as CM.

•	The module schematics variant and version checks require that all general checks have passed and that the master schematic contains every reference designator defined in the module. The MPL_CM_VARIANT must be a positive unsigned integer with three digits, allowing gaps. Similarly, the MPL_CM_VERSION is a positive unsigned integer with three digits, but versions must be consecutive starting at 001. The MPL_CM_TYPE can be either CM or EM. All net labels defined in the version must also exist in the master, a feature implemented after migration. Links between modules are defined by several attributes: MPL_CM_REF_NAME, MPL_CM_REF_VARIANT (three-digit unsigned integer allowing gaps), MPL_CM_REF_VERSION (consecutive three-digit unsigned integer starting at 001), and MPL_CM_REF_TYPE (either CM or EM). The referenced module must exist. If a variant, version, or type already exists, it can be updated only if the topology and netlist are identical, overwritten if the module is unused (not selected in any CM2P), or otherwise the release is denied.

•	The Modular Concept Project (CM2P) enforces several rules to ensure readiness for layout schematic release (RFL). Each project variant version is associated with a version owner. Within CM2P and LM2P populations, multiple module selections are allowed (MNVVT), including multiple selections within a module family (MN). Double module selection rules apply to both CM2P and LM2P populations. Modules in the CM2P population must be of type CM. The populations also enforce module linking, availability in Zuken, and require modules to be released beyond the ML1 stage. Modules must have their visibility set to YES, RFL status as NO, and be marked as ACTIVE. Additionally, reference designators and package information must be consistent across all module schematics within the relevant CM2Ps and LM2Ps to avoid mismatches.
						


•	The Functional Module Concept Project (FCM2P) enforces specific rules to ensure readiness for layout schematic release (RFL). Each module variant must have a defined function variant, and multiple function variants from the same function are not permitted. Double module definitions are disallowed, and the same set of module chains cannot appear more than once within the same function variant as a CM2P or LM2P. Module groups in a deactivated state are not allowed, and empty function variants are prohibited. The system performs existence checks for function groups, functions, function variants, and module family names to ensure data integrity. Empty project tags are not allowed, and duplicate module selections within a single modular chain are prevented to maintain consistency and correctness.

•	Schematic Export in MPLD includes the Bill of Material with all component attributes, complete netlist, native schematic files for viewing or editing, and schematic metadata such as module name, variant, version, type, master, and urgency. During release, multiple checks ensure data integrity and compliance: consistency verification against CompDB/ZCompDB for component attributes (like ECAD_ID, SAP_PN, Part Type), formal netlist error detection (e.g., duplicate component instances), technical identity checks for module updates, and confirmation that the schematic is a subset of the Module Master. It also verifies consistency with assigned CM2Ps to ensure layout/project schematics cover all relevant circuit modules, automates CM2P assignments via unique IDs, checks SAP material status and preferred component usage (blocking release for disallowed statuses), and enforces user permission controls based on roles and group management.
